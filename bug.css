The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, causing unexpected layout or rendering issues.  For example, attempting to use `calc(100% - 50px)` inside a nested element might not calculate correctly if the parent's dimensions aren't fully defined. Another common mistake is incorrect operator precedence or missing spaces around operators within `calc()` expressions. Incorrect units or mismatched unit types within `calc()` can also lead to errors.
